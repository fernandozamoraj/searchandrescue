# searchandrescue
Search and Rescue is an original game that I created using JavaScript.  The entire game is written with Java script.  It uses the simpleGame.js engine as a framework for the game.

The game itself is pretty elementary but it does demonstrate some cool concepts such as

* A score board
* A health bar
* Particle system
* Shake and thunder when the ship crashes

This game was part of my work teams Lunch and Learn series in creating games with JavaScript. We all agreed to a challenge to create a game.  This is the game that I created.
